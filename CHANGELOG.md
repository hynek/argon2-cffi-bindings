# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/).
The first digit of the version is the year, the second digit is incremented with each release, starting at 1 for each year.
The third digit is when we need to start branches for older releases (only for emergencies).

### Added

- Native macOS wheels for Apple Silicon (`universal2`).
  [#2](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi-bindings/pull/2)

### Changed

- The compilation of the vendored *Argon2* C library is now left to *CFFI*.
  This prevents the accidental usage of a system-wide *Argon2* installation.
